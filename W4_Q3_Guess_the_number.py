#  Number Guessing Game
#
# Guess a number the computer chooses in the range I chose.
# So that I can try to find the correct number which was selected by computer.
#
# Acceptance Criteria:
#
#     Computer must randomly pick an integer from user selected a range,
#     i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
#     Your program should prompt the user for guesses
#     if the user guesses incorrectly, it should print whether the guess is too high or too low.
#     If the user guesses correctly, the program should print total time and total number of guesses.
#     You must import some required modules or packages
#     You can assume that the user will enter valid input.
